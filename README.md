<h1>Merge Sort.</h1>

Solved after learning merge sort logic through plain English examples; no programming solutions watched, to make sure I understood how it works.

Pasted in my bubble sort algorithm from a previous project to test speeds.

On a small, hand-typed array, bubble sort performed better by .0001 seconds.

When the array was bumped up to a randomized array from 1 to 10,000, merge really shined.
  Merge sort took about 0.04s each time.
  Bubble sort took upwards of 4s each time!

Neither algo is elegant or optimized, because I wanted to work through the logic of the sorts myself.

But the theory behind each algo's strengths and weaknesses mirror my results.

Neat.
